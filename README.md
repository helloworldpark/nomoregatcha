# No More GATCHA - Demonstrating how dangerous picking random boxes are

GATCHAs are a slang in South Korea, meaning random boxes which give players a random item. 

This project aims to simulate how many times in average do we need to pick a random box to collect all the items.

More precisely, suppose we want to collect N items which are to be only gained by picking a random box. 
If the probability of the items to appear are equal, then we can find that we have to pick N*log(N) times to collect all the items in average.
